This time I focused on learning three main things.\
RTK Queries (Redux Toolkit Queries) and Final Form - I found them really promising, but a little hard to learn and use. I think I should start another project to improve my confidence in these libraries, especially in the second one, as it is used by many big companies around the world.\
I also used Styled Components. I loved the ease of use this library provides. Unfortunately, all files got noticeably longer, but the code is more readable compared to Tailwind classes.

### Built With

- I can see a list of photos in the masonry layout that I have added
- I can add a new photo to the list - the new photo should be on top of the list
- I can search for photos by label
- When I hover a photo, I can see a label and a delete button
- I can delete images
